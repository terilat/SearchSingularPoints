Search for singular points in the system of differential equations

A system of differential equations may have singular points. At these points, the vector field equals zero. There is a classification of phase portraits in the vicinity of these points. The type of phase portrait depends on eigenvalues of the linearized system. My program linearizes system of differential equations, finds eigenvalues and eigenvectors, determines the type of phase portrait and draws vector field in the vicinity of singular points.
